<h1>Colophon</h1>
<p>This book was created using a variety of tools, but the general workflow was as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPUB was created by creating the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-package-def">OPF</a>, then adding the requisite HTML, CSS and scripts to the OPF and creating those files.</li>
  <li>Editing of the OPF and other markup was done in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Webstorm</a></li>
  <li>WYSIWYG editing of the HTML text that forms the chapters was done in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Dreamweaver</a>. An &quot;external tool&quot; shortcut was added to Webstorm to facilitate jumping back and forth.</li>
  <li>A little <a href="https://github.com/rkwright/UpdateModTime">Java program</a> was written (and invoked as a jar) that updates the OPF, setting the dcterms:modified to the current date and time</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/readium/readium-test-files/blob/master/util/scripts/zip-epub-check.sh">bash script</a> was written invoke that jar, zip up all the sources of the Webstorm project and then run them against <a href="https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck">EPUBCheck</a></li>
  </ul>
