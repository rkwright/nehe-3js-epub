<h2>Lesson 8 - Blending and Opacity</h2>


<p>This is a very simple lesson because again three.js does  all the heavy lifting. Still there are a couple of wrinkles to watch for. And, of course, this lesson just barely touches on the whole area of blending, color models, opacity and so on. We'll go a bit deeper later, but for now we'll just get our toes wet.</p>
<p>The lesson is VERY similar to lesson 7 in that we are applying a texture to a cube and using the same keystroke commands for the texture filters and navigation. However, there is only one texture, glass.jpg. And one new command, 'B' which turns on and off the blending.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that's it!  Go on to the next page to see the actual rendered demo in all its blended glory!</p>
